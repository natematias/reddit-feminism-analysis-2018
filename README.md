Marginalized communities online often face disruption from outsiders trying to cause trouble. These communities are targets for coordinated harassment on platforms where anyone can join nearly any discussion and search algorithms enable organized groups to find and disrupt conversations. 

In a two-year collaboration with the /r/feminism community on Reddit, the [Citizens and Technology Lab](https://citizensandtech.org) designed a field experiment to test ideas for reducing this chilling effect on freedom of expression in marginalized groups online.

This repository includes our analysis code, alongside anonymized, aggregated datasets for scientific re-analysis.
