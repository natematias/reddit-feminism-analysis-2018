#  Code & Anonymized/Aggregated Data for: Reducing the Silencing Role of Harassment in Online Feminism Discussions

Marginalized communities online often face disruption from outsiders trying to cause trouble. These communities are targets for coordinated harassment on platforms where anyone can join nearly any discussion and search algorithms enable organized groups to find and disrupt conversations. 

In a study with the /r/feminism community on Reddit, the CAT Lab team, in collaboration with a team of Princeton students, designed a two-year field experiment to test ideas for reducing this chilling effect on freedom of expression in marginalized groups online.

This repository includes our analysis code, alongside anonymized, aggregated datasets for scientific re-analysis.
