82,"I’m a feminist in the sense that I think men and women are inherently equal and should be treated as such.  The brand of feminism I see most represented today and in the Reddit community does not reflect this.  The feminism subreddit seems focused on the pursuit of equality through negativity rather than positivity.  I can provide two examples that might support what I’m trying to say.  From my experience, a modern feminist is more likely to know who John Damore is than Sabrina Pasterski.  And those who condemn John Damore without taking the time to read and understand the scientific consensus behind his thoughts are demonstrating the same behaviour as those who deny climate science because it doesn’t fit their narrative.

I think the problem is that the pursuit of power, or empowerment is different than the pursuit of equality. In the way that society has shifted though, they’re seeking equality in areas which weren’t traditionally their domain.  I think that’s fantastic and great for everyone.  What I don’t agree with is the demand for equal outcome in all situations.  Men and women differ considerably in their biology and this is bound to lead to differences in their interests and perhaps capacities.  Increasing the number of women in STEM careers isn’t about showing outrage at individuals like John Damore but rather hearing his points of view, discussing their merits, and then supporting the hell out of girls like Sabrina Pasterski.  That woman deserves to be an absolute superstar and celebrity among women (and men).  I think that when women like her replace women like the Kardashians as the most followed women in social media, we’ll see real change.  That’s the brand of feminism I represent, one which focuses on finding a natural equilibrium between men and women through positivity and support, rather than negativity and hostility.",FALSE,TRUE,Yes,0,3,TRUE,TRUE

I stand for equality, but the modern day ""feminsim"" is really something else..

I commented ""Poor kid.."" on that video, because obviously the parents are irresponsible people.. and I got banned for that!
