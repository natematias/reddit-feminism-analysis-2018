4/17/2018 9:21:58,Yes,4,
4/17/2018 9:25:32,Undecided,4,I wanted to share a blog post about feminism but it sadly doesnt show up so I just deleted it.

4/17/2018 9:29:20,No,1,"i comment because feminists are extremely intolerant and quick to ban so sometimes i come in here on new accounts and help to broaden the horizon of  a few young women who might have been told some lies, like that a wage gap exists, or that they are being oppressed by some nebulous thing"
4/17/2018 9:30:11,Yes,5,
4/17/2018 9:30:22,Yes,3,
4/17/2018 9:31:45,Yes,4,"Granted, I’m a guy, but my only issue is that there are so many splintered groups of feminism. I wish it could be simplified, but I also understand that women face a multitude of issues that I don’t and problems that I wouldn’t even be able to think of, so I appreciate that there’s a section of feminism for everyone."
4/17/2018 9:31:58,Yes,4,Sometimes I find the sub is a little too open towards TERFy stuff
4/17/2018 9:32:21,No,1,They banned me for disagreeing with a post
4/17/2018 9:33:10,Undecided,4,Can be a too restrictive of comments. If someone says something assholish let the public decide don't delete the comment
4/17/2018 9:33:35,Yes,5,Feminism is a concept that needs to be spread and not one which people should not be punished for not understanding. The community is often quite bad at understanding this and further contributes to the stereotype that feminism is anti-male rather than pro-equality.

4/17/2018 9:44:33,No,1,"I don't think men and women are same. Not biologically, mentally or psycologically. Due to their respective nature, and their respective requirements, comparing both of them is uselss. Fighting with rape, sexual assualt and harassment should be the main objective, but some women seem to use this for unworthy benefits, false sympathy, to supprss men, manipulate law for own advantage, falsely frame others and much more. There should be a balance in both. Feminism is important for those women who actually face problems, but it is used negatively and now nobody can trust them. "

Not blithely following the consensus on literally every issue? Banned! /r/feminism is a cesspool of thoughtless groupthink.
4/17/2018 10:10:51,Yes,3,"Nice subreddit, active community"
4/17/2018 10:11:27,Yes,5,"The last question of the survey is confusing as there are different ways to interpret it. Does it mean ""which diagram represents the amount of overlap between your ideology and r/feminism""? Or ""which diagram represents how much you interact with r/feminism""?

4/17/2018 10:17:41,Yes,5,"I was banned for using ""r/roastme"" as a joke despite being pretty active and well received in the community. I was even criticizing the individuals who are only subscribed to the subreddit to only disagree with feminists because they aren't feminists. Whoever banned me is an idiot, but oh well keep the anti-feminists there and kick genuine feminists out. "
4/17/2018 10:19:51,No,1,I was banned for expressing mild views on a relevant subject.
4/17/2018 10:20:46,Yes,7,
4/17/2018 10:22:42,Yes,3,"I’m a feminist in the sense that I think men and women are inherently equal and should be treated as such.  The brand of feminism I see most represented today and in the Reddit community does not reflect this.  The feminism subreddit seems focused on the pursuit of equality through negativity rather than positivity.  I can provide two examples that might support what I’m trying to say.  From my experience, a modern feminist is more likely to know who John Damore is than Sabrina Pasterski.  And those who condemn John Damore without taking the time to read and understand the scientific consensus behind his thoughts are demonstrating the same behaviour as those who deny climate science because it doesn’t fit their narrative.

I think the problem is that the pursuit of power, or empowerment is different than the pursuit of equality. In the way that society has shifted though, they’re seeking equality in areas which weren’t traditionally their domain.  I think that’s fantastic and great for everyone.  What I don’t agree with is the demand for equal outcome in all situations.  Men and women differ considerably in their biology and this is bound to lead to differences in their interests and perhaps capacities.  Increasing the number of women in STEM careers isn’t about showing outrage at individuals like John Damore but rather hearing his points of view, discussing their merits, and then supporting the hell out of girls like Sabrina Pasterski.  That woman deserves to be an absolute superstar and celebrity among women (and men).  I think that when women like her replace women like the Kardashians as the most followed women in social media, we’ll see real change.  That’s the brand of feminism I represent, one which focuses on finding a natural equilibrium between men and women through positivity and support, rather than negativity and hostility."

4/17/2018 10:35:48,Yes,2,
4/17/2018 10:36:15,Yes,1,Commented on a post claiming BDSM is violence against women. Brought a personal example of how it is not and how I know many women who want and ask for men to do it because it is good erotically and romantically. Got banned from the subreddit and muted.
4/17/2018 10:38:34,Undecided,1,"I checked out the forum once and clicked on a video where a 3 year old was screaming ""smash the patriarchy!"". It think that is very irresponsible behavior from their parents. No matter what worldview you have or what political stance you have, you should not teach your kids to parrot your slogans at that age.

I stand for equality, but the modern day ""feminsim"" is really something else..
There are many oldschool feminists who were very good and bright people, and actually cared for equality and the well being of all people, like Christina Hoff Sommers, but these people are something else..

I commented ""Poor kid.."" on that video, because obviously the parents are irresponsible people.. and I got banned for that! 
It is completely ridiculous to ban someone for saying ""Poor kid.."", but it just goes to show what that forum is all about.
Instantly ban someone who just seem like they do not go with the narrative.

The moderators on that forum and many of the users ""allowed"" to post there.. should be ashamed of themselves!"

4/17/2018 11:12:06,Yes,6,I made a pro-feminist comment and got a private message in response. The user who messaged me made a very un-feminist response to me. I'm guessing the user didn't feel commenting on r/feminism due to fear of backlash and that's why they chose to private message rather than comment. Also I identify as a cis male if that's helpful.

Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence.

4/17/2018 12:12:38,Yes,6,It is sometimes difficult in the sub because of disruption by anti-Feminists. As with all progressive subreddits strict moderation is unfortunately needed.

Anything outside of their narrative will nit be listened too.

4/17/2018 15:12:58,Yes,5,"I find a lot of feminist content on Reddit is politicized and concentrated on American identity politics. Being a white Canadian woman from a low SES family, I often feel alienated by this content. If r/feminism could be maintained as a welcome place for ideological discussion rather than one that was heavily partisan and toxic, it would really stand out in a positive way. I think for the most part, it already does that, though I haven't browsed the subreddit long enough to have much of an impression. Allowing more debate might increase activity, be educational for users and could help feminists improve their articulation of arguments and facts, but I realize that the subreddit might be experiencing a terrible level of trolling and harassment which may make that impossible. Good luck with your research and the subreddit! PS - It's odd that '4' is the middle number in the scale and yet the image isn't a 50/50 representation. How they're arranged makes 4 seem like it's 50% or greater 'relationship' with r/feminism, but it's actually less. I just wanted to mention that in case it wasn't intentional. And what does relate to the subreddit mean? Do I agree with the content and discussions on r/feminism, do I find it personally relevant, do I identify with it, do I empathize with the views?

I have wondered if it’s because the people who upvote links are casual, stereotypical feminists, though not actually feminists because they want special and not equal treatment for women, while those that take the time to comment are more truly feminists, wanting equal rights for men and women. I doubt you could or even should implement a voting system that prioritized the upvoted of commenters over casual upvoters, but it would be interesting to see the effect that would have on upvoted content."

4/19/2018 0:22:07,Yes,2,"Feel like I was chastised for not being “feminist enough” which was weird as I have a Bachelors Degree in Women’s Studies and a Masters degree in Corporate Gender Diversity so it was odd to have such a feeling of not belonging when I’ve committed my whole life to feminism. Also, I’m aware that I’m priveleged as a white western woman. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t understand intersectionality or that I’m incapable of adding anything useful to the feminist discourse. "
4/19/2018 7:11:54,No,4,"I'm male. I am not a feminist. I don't think I will ever call myself one. ""Ally"" doesn't sit well with me, either, but I do acknowledge the issues women face today in society and generally agree with feminists."

4/19/2018 14:44:58,Yes,2,"I find the sub to be interesting to some degree, but very far from truly feminist. Very white feminist centric and very little education otherwise. Not an inviting place to be as a person of color, I often feel silenced by the comments and when I did try to speak up, very misunderstood. I wouldn't consider many of the women participating to be actually feminists, too much internalized racism on display and a general lack of understanding regarding  global issues affecting women. Overall 2/10....seems to be a reason there are dedicated subs to women of color :/"
4/19/2018 15:53:36,No,2,"I understand a sub of this nature gets a lot of trolls. That is unfortunate. But I think a lot of comments get removed that are serious inquiries or observations simply because they don't fit into the narrative. I started stopping by /r/feminism to better understand why modern feminists would allign themselves with some pretty divisive figures (Linda Sarsour for example who has said to a female genital mutilation survivor Ayin Hirsi Ali that she doesn't deserve a vagina. Or Celebs who have said that anyone who didn't vote for Hillary, I voted Jill Stein, still a female, should be shunned. While I plan and try to participate kindly with respect, I feel that if you say anything that doesn't line up perfectly with some radical views you will have your comment removed. I think this causes division in an area where we don't need division. I really wish that the mods would be a little more open minded."
4/19/2018 16:32:30,Yes,4,"There are a lot of different perspectives and opinions about what feminism is.  Most women want to see other women succeed.  I think that my age along with a career lived in a male dominated field gives me a very different perspective than my college aged daughter.  I feel like it’s more of a practical view.  I get very frustrated with a lot of aspects of modern feminism because I see certain things that are embraced by modern feminism  torpedo a lot of talented young women.  Regardless, I feel like the core aspect of feminism is to see women advancing in all aspects of society and that’s something both me and my daughter support.  I think that it’s beneficial to feminism to make sure that we understand the feminism of our mothers and grandmothers instead of having an all or nothing view of what it takes to be a feminist."
